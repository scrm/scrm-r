scrm R Package
=======================

_scrm_ is a coalescence simulator for the evolution 
of biological sequences. It is available as a command line program at
[scrm.github.io](https://scrm.github.io).

This R package contains a copy _scrm_, packaged for convenient usage in R.


Installation
======================

It is recommended to use the current CRAN version. It can be installed
from within R using

```
install.packages('scrm')
```


Usage
======================
Use the function `scrm::scrm()` to call _scrm_:
```
library('scrm')
sum_stats <- scrm('5 1 -r 10 100 -t 5 -oSFS')
```


Help & Documentation
======================
- The basic usage of `scrm::scrm()` is explained in its R help page `help('scrm')`.
- The package contains a vignette on _scrm_'s command line arguments: `vignette('scrm-Arguments')`.
- Online documentation for the command line program is available in 
  [_scrm's Wiki_](https://github.com/paulstaab/scrm/wiki).
