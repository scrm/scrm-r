\title{Simulating the evolution of biological sequences}
\description{
The Sequential Coalescent with Recombination Model (SCRM) is an
approximation of the Ancestral Recombination Graph. It can be used to
simulate the neutral evolution of chromosomes/biological sequences
subject to possibly complicated population structure.
The program \emph{scrm} is an implementation of this model that is designed to
act as an drop-in replacement for the widely adopted coalescent simulator
\emph{ms}. This package contains \emph{scrm} along with an R interface.
