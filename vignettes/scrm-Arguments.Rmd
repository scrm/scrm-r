# Command Line Arguments

scrm is uses a syntax compatible with the popular program [ms][1]. There are, however, a few differences to ms: 

* scrm can not simulate 
    * gene conversions (`-c` in ms) and
    * a fix number of segregating sites (`-s`),
* the option `-L` produces a slightly different output and
* it additionally implements the flags 
    * `-l` (approximation), 
    * `-sr` (changing recombination rate), 
    * `-st` (changing mutation rate),
    * `-eI` (sampling at past time points) and
    * `-oSFS` (generates frequency spectra). 
    
For all other options, you can also refer to [ms' manual][2] to get a detailed description of what the commands are doing. scrm should happily execute any ms command that does not contain `-c` and `-s`. Also scrm has somewhat stricter requirements regarding the order of arguments if population admixture (`-es`) is involved.

## General Syntax
The command line options for scrm look like

    scrm <nsamp> <rep> [...]

where _nsamp_ is the total number of samples taken (in all populations and at all times), _rep_ is the number of independent loci/chromosomes to generate and the `[...]` is an optional placeholder for an arbitrary number of command flags described below.

## Basic Parameters

### Recombination

* `-r <R> <L>`: Set the recombination rate to _R = 4*N0*r_ and the length of all loci to L base pairs. _r_ is the recombination rate per locus.
* `-l <l>`: Use approximation rather than simulating the exact ARG. Within a sliding window of length _l_ base pairs all linkage information is considered when building the genealogy. To positions outside of this window, some linkage  is ignored. Setting _l=0_ produces the SMC' and _l=-1_ or _l>L_ deactivates the approximation. 

### Population structure & migration
In all commands, migrations rates _M = 4*N0*m_, where _m_ is the fraction of a population that is replaced with migrants from other populations each generation (looking forwards in time).

* `-I <npop> <s1> ... <sn> [<M>]`: Use an island model with _npop_ populations, where _s1_ to _sn_ individuals are sampled from population 1 to n, respectively. Optionally assume a symmetric migration rate of _M_.
* `-M <M>`: Assume a symmetric migration rate of _M/(npop-1)_. 
* `-m <i> <j> <M>`: Set the migration rate from population _j_ to population _i_ to _M_ (looking forward in time).
* `-ma <M11> <M21> ... <M21> ...`: Set the migration matrix (Dimension is _npop x npop_). Diagonals elements are ignored but required.  

### Population size changes
* `-n <i> <n>`: Set the present day size of population _i_ to _n*N0_.
* `-G <a>`: Set the exponential growth rate of all populations to _a_.
* `-g <i> <a>`: Set the exponential growth rate of population _i_ to _a_.

### Summary Statistics

* `-t < $\theta$ >`: Set the mutation rate to $\theta = 4N_0u$, where _u_ is the neutral mutation rate per locus. If this options is given, scrm generates the segregating sites output.
* `-T`: Print the local genealogies in newick format.
* `-O`: Print the local genealogies in the `oriented forest` format as described in [Kelleher _et al._ (2014)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2014.05.001) [since v1.2].
* `-L`: Print the TMRCA and the local tree length for each segment (behaves different to ms).
* `-oSFS`: Print the site frequency spectrum. Requires that the mutation rate $\theta$ is given with the '-t' option.
* `-SC [ms|rel|abs]`: Scaling of sequence positions. Either relative to the locus length between 0 and 1 (`rel`), absolute in base pairs (`abs`) or `ms`'s scaling (default) where the positions in the _segregating sites_ output are relative, and the positions in the trees output are absolute (`ms`)[since v1.3]. 

### Reproducibility

* `-seed <SEED> [<SEED2> <SEED3>]`: Specifies a seed for the simulation. You can input up to three non-negative numbers. If no seed is given, scrm randomly samples one using entropy provided by the operating system. To reproduce a previous simulation, use the single number in the second line of the output.

## Time specific parameters
The command this section all have a time _t_ as first parameter. Changes made by the commands affect the time from _t_ further back into the past. All times in units of _4*N0_ generations.

### Population structure & migration

* `-eI <t> <s1> ... <sn>`: Sample _s1_ to _sn_ individuals are from population _1_ to _n_, respectively, at time _t_. 
* `-eM <t> <M>`: Assume a symmetric migration rate of _M/(npop-1)_ at time _t_.
* `-em <t> <i> <j> <M>`: Set the migration rate from population _j_ to population _i_ to _M_ (looking forward in time) at time _t_.
* `-ema <npop> <M11> <M12> ... <M21> ...`: Set the migration matrix (Dimension is _npop x npop_). Diagonals elements are ignored but required.  

### Population size changes

* `-eN <t> <n>`: Set the size of all populations to _n*N0_ at time _t_.
* `-en <t> <i> <n>`: Set the size of population _i_ to _n*N0_ at time _t_. 
* `-eg <t> <i> <a>`: Set the exponential growth rate of population _i_ to _a_ at time _t_.
* `-eG <t> <a>`: Set the exponential growth rate of all populations to _a_ at time _t_.

### Population Splits & Merges

* `-es <t> <i> <p>`: Population admixture, replaces a fraction of _1-p_ of population _i_ with individuals a from population _npop + 1_ which is ignored afterwards (viewed forward in time). Technically (and looking backwards in time), a new population _n+1_ with size _N0_ is created. Migration (to & from) and growth rates for this population are initially 0. Each lines in population _i_ is moved to the new population with probability _1-p_. Please sort multiple `-es` arguments by their time to avoid confusion about the numbering of populations. Please give the arguments that affect the whole population (`-M`, `-N`, `-G` & `-ma`) before giving the first `-es`. Also, their timed equivalents (`-eM`, `-eN`, `-eG`, `-eI` & `-ema`) position on the command line events must be the same as in time (only relative to `-es`). 
`scrm` throws an error if any of these conditions is not met. In doubt, just sort all command line arguments by time.
* `-ej <t> <i> <j>`: Adds a specialization event in population _i_ that creates population _j_ (forwards in time). Technically (and looking backwards in time), it merges population _j_ into population _i_ at time _t_. Migration rates into population _j_ are set to 0 for the time further back into the past.
 
## Sequence specific parameters
The following commands change the model parameters from at a sequence position _s_.

* `-sr <s> <R>`: Set the recombination rate to _R_ starting at position _s_.
* `-st <s> <$\theta$>`: Set the mutation rate to $\theta$ starting at position _s_.
